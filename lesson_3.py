# Set the variable in_list to whatever value you want. Let's use 
# [ 5, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 8, 7 ] as an example.

# Use for loops, while loops, and whatever else we've learned to 
# set the variable x to the length of in_list - but you may NOT use len! 
# Try to mimic the behavior of len.

# Create a program to accept words from a user, and add them to a dictionary. 
# At the end, use print(mydict) to print out the user's work to them




################################################
# Extend your dictionary program from assignment #2 to have some added capabilities:

# Make sure the user cannot enter more than one translation for the same word, 
# in either direction. For example, if ‘dog’: ‘Hund’ is already an entry in the 
# dictionary, then adding a new translation for ‘dog’ OR another word that translates 
# to ‘Hund’ should fail.

# Make sure the user cannot input a key that contains a space, but a value that 
# contains a space is acceptable. So adding ‘the dog’ : ‘Hund’ should fail, but 
# ‘dog’ : ‘der Hund’ is fine.



################################################
# Instead of printing out the dictionary when the program is done, ask the user 
# for a sentence and “translate” it, word-by-word, as output. 

# If a word has no translation, use the word unchanged.
